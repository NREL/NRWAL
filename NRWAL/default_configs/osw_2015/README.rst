Offshore Wind Cost Equations
****************************

This library includes equations for modeling costs of offshore wind
technologies and was developed by wind energy experts at NREL. These equations
were ported over from the Offshore Regional Cost Analysis (ORCA) model and are
associated with the following publication:
