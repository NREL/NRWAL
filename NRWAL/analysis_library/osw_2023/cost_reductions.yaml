# As of June 2023, all years are COD! NOT FID!
# ncf values are 0 because we will model directly

# capex reductions are based on learning rates of 8.8% (fixed) and 11.5% (float) (matches FORCE Report)
# floating capex trajectory has a scaling factor of 3 (cite Oregon study)

# opex trajectories derived from Wiser et al. (2021) Expert Elicitation by 
# assuming same rate of reduction from 2019-2035 applies 2022 to 2050 and 
# taking a curve in the same shape as the capex learning curve, but with a 
# final magnitude of reduction based on the value obatined from wiser
# floating opex trajectory has a scaling factor of 2 to approximate the same 
# commercial maturity date as the floating capex trajectory
