# As of June 2023, all years are COD! NOT FID!
# ncf values are negative because they represent improvements
# fixed-bottom ncf and opex trajectories derived from Wiser et al. (2021)
# Expert Elicitation by assuming same rate of reduction from 2019-2035 applies
# between 2022 and 2050
# floating ncf trajectory is assumed to be the same as fixed-bottom
# floating opex trajectory derived based on Wiser et al. (2021) by
# assuming present-day opex is eqivalent to 2021 COE Review and 2035 opex is
# median value from expert survey (approx. $80.50/kW-yr). Assuming same rate of
# reduction from 2019-2035 applies between 2022 and 2050
# capex reductions are based on a 7.3% learning rate
# floating capex trajectory includes a 2.5x multiplier to scale initial costs 
# from commercial-scale to pilot scale (matches FORCE Report)
