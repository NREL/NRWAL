# Floating substructure, assuming a 3.3 cm steel wall thickness to match the mass of the 15MW reference semisubmersible platform. Further documentation available in a .docx file called summary_semisub_costmodel.docx
# for a 15 MW turbine, the semisub is roughly 1.8e7 USD. For a 20 MW, semisub is roughly 2.2e7 USD.

substructure: 
  (600/turbine_capacity) * (4240000 * turbine_capacity ** 0.608 - 4000000)

# foundation cost is derived from mooring line and anchor equation costs and output by find_mooring_system_cost_curve.py
# remains to be updated because those equations are from 2015
foundation:
  (600/turbine_capacity) * (6095.315 * depth + 1810405.103)
