Welcome to the Getting Started with NRWAL Example Project!
**********************************************************

So you want to use NRWAL huh? Well it's super easy. Follow these steps:

#. Create a new conda environment using python >= 3.7
#. Run the following: ``pip install nrel-nrwal``
#. Copy this directory structure (everything in ``getting_started/``) somewhere you want to set up your project.
#. Update the filepaths in ``config.yaml`` and ``run_nrwal.py``.
#. Run the following: ``python run_nrwal.py``
#. You should see some printouts of the evaluated equations.
#. Go ahead and build more equations in ``equations/model.yaml`` and reference them in the ``config.yaml`` file.
#. Build out your model and feel free to open a pull request if you want your model archived in the NRWAL library!
